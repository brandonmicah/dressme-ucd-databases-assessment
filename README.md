# UCD Databases Module Assessment - UPLIFT

## Project Concept
The project concept was to create a simple CRUD application. I decided on a social media clone where users would have the ability to post, comment, like and share images and thoughts.

## Project Features
The main goal of this assessment was to create a CRUD application that would utilize a Database. To build this application a Postgres Database along with JavaScript, Python and the Flask framework were the main components used to create this web application. The incorporation of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap was also required to achieve this final goal. The final product was to be hosted on render.com.
